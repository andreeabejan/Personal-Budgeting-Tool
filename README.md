# Personal-Budgeting-Tool
I created this project in my second year of University for the Computer Networks seminar, using Linux as the operating system. 

Based on the client/server structure, the server can process different commands based on financial related issues for multiple users simultaneously. A more detailed description about the project can be found in the technical report.
